## Enviroment

To begin with, a nodejs supported enviroment with express framework is required, and make sure you're using a browser that support CSS3. We recommend you to use Chrome to experience this project.

After doing that, you're supposed to be able to enjoy playing by visiting http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
